# NuBank2YNAB
A hackish app to automatically transfer NuBank transactions to YNAB

## How does it works?
It's still very beta, and I did it to sufice my own needs, if you want to use it for yourself, you must creante an HardcodedConfig file before compiling with your TOKENS and IDs. I'll improve it in the future so it become plug-and-play. :)
